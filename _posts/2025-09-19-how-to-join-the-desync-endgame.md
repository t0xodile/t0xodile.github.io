I had the awesome oppertunity to head to DEFCON 33 this year with some help from Portswigger! As a result of the trip, I also got the chance to absolutely nerd out about their latest research paper [HTTP/1 must die: The desync endgame](https://http1mustdie.com) on their blog. The post covers how to get stuck in with desync vulnerabilities as a pentester or a bug bounty hunter. In particular, how to adapt the [HTTP Request Smuggler extension](https://github.com/PortSwigger/http-request-smuggler) in order to find novel desync attacks.
