Welcome to Thomas Stacey's (aka "t0xodile") personal blog. Here you'll find content about my adventures in penetration testing and security research, with a **heavy** focus on web application security. If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to reach out to one of my socials. 


So, a little about me taken directly from my LinkedIn profile... I am a penetration tester, security researcher and full-time Lego enthusiast. I have a passion for exploring and applying new (and far too complicated) attack techniques, and am constantly searching for opportunities to continue my personal development and contribute to the wider cyber security community.
